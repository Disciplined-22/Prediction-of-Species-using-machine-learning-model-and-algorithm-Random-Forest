# "ğŸŒ² Random Forest Model ğŸŒ²"

Imagine making a big decision by asking advice from many friends. Random Forest is like that but for computers! It's a smart model that combines the wisdom of many decision-makers (trees) to give you a super reliable answer. In our project, we use 100 of these decision-making trees to make predictions. It's like having a forest of advice for the best results! ğŸŒ³âœ¨
