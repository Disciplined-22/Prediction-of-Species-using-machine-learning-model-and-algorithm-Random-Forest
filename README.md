# "🌲 Random Forest Model 🌲"

Imagine making a big decision by asking advice from many friends. Random Forest is like that but for computers! It's a smart model that combines the wisdom of many decision-makers (trees) to give you a super reliable answer. In our project, we use 100 of these decision-making trees to make predictions. It's like having a forest of advice for the best results! 🌳✨

#  Project Description:
Implemented a machine learning model utilizing the Random Forest algorithm for species prediction. The Random Forest model incorporates the collective insights of 3 decision-making trees, providing robust and reliable predictions. Successfully applied this approach to achieve accurate species classification in the project.
